## Problem Statement
Topological Sort of a directed graph (a graph with unidirectional edges) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (U, V) from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering.

Given a directed graph, find the topological ordering of its vertices.
