# datastruct-algorithm

## How to run from command-line
Before this, I depended on VSCode's setting to run them from the IDE, but which requires some configurations that I am tired to learn the full details~
```
$ pwd
/Users/zhangmengxi/learning/datastruct-algorithm/java_lang_interface/concurrent/thread
$ javac -cp "../../../lib/*" MyTest.java 
$ java -cp "../../../lib/*:." org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MyTest
JUnit version 4.13
.Hello world!

Time: 0.007

OK (1 test)


```

## Notes:

Use [this directory](https://github.com/lukeZhangMengxi/datastruct-algorithm/tree/master/dp/knapsack) as the latest multi-algorithm template for single problem.

Use [this](https://github.com/lukeZhangMengxi/datastruct-algorithm/blob/master/patterns/sliding_window/min_window_subsequence/MyTest.java#L16) for junit test timer reference.
