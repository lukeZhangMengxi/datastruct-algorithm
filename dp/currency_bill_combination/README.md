## Problem statement
Given a list of currency bills, you are required to count the number of ways in which you can represent a certain amount. For example, if you have only two kinds of bills, $10 and $20, and you want to represent $30, there are only two ways:

1. 3 bills of $10
1. 1 bill of $20 and 1 bill of $10.
