## Problem statement
Nick is standing next to a staircase that leads to his apartment. The staircase has n total steps; Nick knows he can climb anywhere between 1 and m steps in one jump. He thinks about how many ways there are to climb this staircase. He realizes it is a big number since there are a lot of possible combinations. So, he has asked you to write an algorithm for him that tells him the number of possible ways to climb a staircase given n (number of steps) and, m (number of steps covered in biggest jump).
