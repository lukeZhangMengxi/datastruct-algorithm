## Problem statement
Given two strings, we want to find the length of the longest substring common in both these strings. For example, if we have two strings, "hello elf" and "hello yourself", we can see two prominent substrings: "hello " and "elf". Since "hello " is longer, this will be the longest common substring for the given pair of strings.
